** [IMPORTANT NOTICE] This project relies heavily on file-names. Please DO NOT change any filename in the project **
** For demo purpose, we've set-up MySQL and MongoDB on cloud with the necessary tables created and sufficient user-privileges. You could just do step 1 and 2 to run the project **

1. Install the necessary dependencies by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the console

2. Execute the program by running `python main.py` in the console and follow the instructions on the screen

If you want to test/run the project with your own/different instance of MySQL and MongoDB, then

1. Create a dedicated database in MySQL and MongoDB for this project

2. Create the `DEPARTMENT`, `DEPT_LOCATIONS`, `EMPLOYEE`, `PROJECT`, and `WORKS_ON ` tables using `scripts/create-tables.sql`

3. Ensure that the `user` has sufficient privileges(`INSERT` and `DELETE`) on the database in both MySQL and MongoDB.

4. Add the credentials for MySQL and MongoDB in `config.py`.

5. Execute the program by running `python main.py` in the console and follow the instructions on the screen

NOTE:
- The data required by the `DEPARTMENT`, `DEPT_LOCATIONS`, `EMPLOYEE`, `PROJECT`, and `WORKS_ON ` tables are present in the respective text files under the `data/` directory
- The SQL scripts required to create the necessary tables, convert the query results as JSON arrays with nested JSON objects are present in the `scripts/` directory
